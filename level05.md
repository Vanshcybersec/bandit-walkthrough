Level 4 -> Level 5

LEVEL GOAL:

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:

-In this level we are asked to open the only human readable file.

-There can be many files which may be human readable or not. If you want to find which file is human readable ASCII text then opening every single one of those files can be really hectic so what we can do instead is we can type the command "file -- *" as simple typing "file *" wont work, it will show some errors like there is no directory or any other.

-There are other ways but since we are beginners this is the best. As we solve more of this levels we may be able to create those tough scripts.

For more understanding of these commands you can use "command --help" in the terminal which will show how to use a command deeply and efficiently.
