Level7 -> Level8

LEVEL GOAL:

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

wHAT i'VE LEARNED:

-For solving level 7 to level 8 we first used ls which showed us a file named data.txt then we used ls which showed us random letters and words. Our password is the letters besides the word millionth so we used the command grep which located the line with the word millionth.
