Level Goal:

What I've learned:

-grep searches for matching text patterns inside files or output. It's full form is global regular expression print. 

- Sort- sorts line alphabetically or numerically.
- 
- uniq- it removes duplicate adjacent files so it is wise to use it with sort as sort helps us making duplicate files go side by side. uniq -u file.txt shows files that appear only once.

- String- extracts readable(printable) text from binary files.
 
- tr means translate or transport. It can replace or remove characters.
  
- tar means tape archives. it aarchives or extracts .tar files.
  
- base64-decodes or encodes data using base64 coding.
  
- gzip or GNU zip is used to compress or decompress .gz files
  
- bzip or Burrows-Wheeler zip 2 (ses BWT or huffman coding) also compresses or decompresses the files.

  For more understanding of these commands you can use "command --help" in the terminal which will show how to use a command deeply and efficiently.
