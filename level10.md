Level9 -> Level10

LEVEL GOAL:

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:

- Learned how to use `strings` to extract human-readable text from a binary file.
  
- Practiced using `grep` to search for a line that matches a specific pattern.
  
- Understood how to find a line that **starts with certain characters** using `^` (caret symbol) in grep.
  
- Learned the value of combining multiple tools using pipes (`|`) to narrow down useful data from noisy output.
