My overthewire bandit notes and learning progress using kali Linux

** Spoiler warning **

I've written notes to help track my learning progress, but i avoid posting exact answers and passwords to respect the game's rules and other player's experience.
If you are playing bandit too try solving it on your own first, this repo focuses on concepts and skills learned through it and not the actual answers.
These are my personal notes from playing the [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame on OverTheWire.  
I’ve tried my best **not to include any direct spoilers, passwords, or copy-paste solutions** — just the concepts and tools I learned.
If you’re playing Bandit, give it a real try before reading anything below — you’ll learn more that way!

What is bandit?

Bandit is a beginner-friendly wargame that teaches Linux basics and command-line skills through hacking style-challenges.
I am solving it using kali Linux on a virtual Machine(VM) as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.
