Level 0 -> Level 1

LEVEL GOAL:

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:

-SSH stands for secure shell. 
Its a command and a prompt used to securely connect to another computer over the network (usually remotely). 
You can access the remote system's terminal, run commands on it, transfer files using tools like scp or sftp, administer servers, work on hacking labs or CTFs and do port forwarding or tunelling.

-ls stands for list. It lists files and directories in the current working directory.

-cat stands for concatenate. It reads and displays the contents of the files. We can also use it to combine multiple files.

For more understanding of these commands you can use "command --help" in the terminal which will show how to use a command deeply and efficiently.
