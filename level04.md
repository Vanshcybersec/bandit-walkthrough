Level 3 -> Level 4

LEVEL GOAL:

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:

-To open a hidden file you first have to use ls -a simply using ls wont show the hidden file. 

-'-a' is shortcut for -all, it shows all files including hidden files when used with ls. 

-The file will be show in ". .. .filename" format where . is the current directory and .. is the parent directory.

-To create a hidden file you can use touch .filename. 

-touch is used for creating an empty file. The '.' is used to make the file hidden. 

For more understanding of these commands you can use "command --help" in the terminal which will show how to use a command deeply and efficiently.

-you can use echo to add content in a hidden file.
