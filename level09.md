Level8 -> Level9

LEVEL GOAL:

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:

- How to identify and extract a human-readable string hidden inside a binary file using the `strings` command.
  
- The use of `strings` to scan for plain text within non-text (binary) files.
  
- Reinforced my understanding that not all files contain readable content just by using `cat`, and some require special tools.
  
- Learned how to pipe output (`|`) to make Linux commands more powerful and efficient.

  For more understanding of these commands you can use "command --help" in the terminal which will show how to use a command deeply and efficiently.
